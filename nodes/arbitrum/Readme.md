# Arbitrum Deployment

This folder contains smart contracts and deployment configurations for the Arbitrum network.

## Overview

Arbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that offers lower transaction costs and faster confirmation times while maintaining Ethereum's security guarantees.

## Structure

- `contracts/` - Smart contract source files
- `scripts/` - Deployment and interaction scripts
- `test/` - Contract test files

## Deployment

The smart contracts in this folder are specifically configured for deployment on the Arbitrum network. Make sure to use the correct Arbitrum network endpoints and chain IDs when deploying:

- Arbitrum One (Mainnet): Chain ID 42161
- Arbitrum Goerli (Testnet): Chain ID 421613

## Notes

- Always test deployments on Arbitrum testnet before deploying to mainnet
- Ensure proper gas configuration for Arbitrum transactions
- Keep track of deployed contract addresses for future reference
